## Data-driven Planning System

In X-lab, GAC R&D, Guangzhou, China. 2023.01 - Present

- Designed a multi-modal neural network with a space-time attention mechanism, enhancing model robustness and decision quality.
- Developed an end-to-end imitation learning pipeline and deployed it using ROS2 for real-time applications.
- Contributed to a log-based simulator (LogSim) to align simulated environments with real-world fleet dynamics.
